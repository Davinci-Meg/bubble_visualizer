#### Dynamic Bubble Visualization with Sound Interaction

This Processing sketch visualizes bubbles that dynamically change size based on the amplitude of an audio file. Each bubble's color is determined by its RGB values loaded from a CSV file.

#### How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Processing installed (download from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/download/)).
   - Place your audio file (`Debussy.mp3` in this example) and a CSV file (`bubble_data.csv` in this example) in the same directory as the Processing sketch.

2. **Run the Sketch:**
   - Open the Processing IDE and run the sketch (`BubbleVisualization.pde`).

3. **Interaction:**
   - The bubbles' sizes respond to the volume of the audio file.
   - The initial sizes and RGB values of bubbles are loaded from the CSV file.
   - Adjust the `volumeThreshold` variable in the code to control when the bubble sizes change in response to audio volume.

#### Files Included

- `BubbleVisualization.pde`: Processing sketch file.
- `Debussy.mp3`: Example audio file used for visualization.
- `bubble_data.csv`: Example CSV file containing initial bubble positions, sizes, and RGB values.

#### Requirements

- Processing 3.0 or higher.
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

#### Notes

- Ensure your audio file is in the same directory as the Processing sketch and correctly referenced in the code (`soundFile = new SoundFile(this, "Debussy.mp3");`).
